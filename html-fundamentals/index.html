  <h2>Rebel Cyborg Lobsters sighted near Westport</h2>
  <p>Unconfirmed reports of heavily mechanised lobsters gathering in shallow waters just north of Westport. There are some indications these large, blue and silver lobsters may be a similar variety to those that destroyed Sydney last month. West Coast residents are urged to evacuate immediately.</p>
  <p>For evacuation information and emergency planning please see the newly establised <a href="#">Crustacean Related Advice Bureau (C.R.A.B.) website.</a></p>

  <h2>"Beloved Family Member" mourned</h2>
  <p>A grieving family are asking the public to be mindful that only the cyborg mutant lobsters are a threat, after their beloved pet G&#233;rard (named for the French poet G&#233;rarde de Nerval who famously kept a pet lobster) was taken from his tank after a break-in at their home.</p>
  <p>"G&#233;rard hated the mutant lobsters. He never did any harm to anyone," said eight year old Timmy. "Except for the people he pinched."</p>
