One: Search Engines
- Search engines should be be non-literal (handle typos etc.
- A simple rather than advanced search is usually preferable - present it as this at least initially.

Two: PDFs
- not appropriate for online reading
- layout is not optimised, breaks the flow
- appropriate for documents for printing

Three: Link Colours
- ensure link colour changes when link has been visited
- not doing so is shown to cause confusion among users

Four: Text
- Writing for the web is different to writing for print
- Text should be easily scannable
- Make use of subheadings, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, short paragraphs etc.

Five: Font size
- Allow this to be adjustable to meet readers' needs

Six: Search Engine Visibility
- Pay close attention to title and tagline
- Consider alphabeticisation of title in bookmarks and how easy it will be to find.

Seven: Adverts
- Users tune out or close elements that look like adverts.
- Avoid banner-shaped elements, pop-ups and blinking text.

Eight: Design Conventions
- Avoid deviating from existing design conventions
- Doing so will confuse users and make things more difficult for them

Nine: Opening links in new windows
- Don't do this - it overrides the users' choice.
- It also disables effective use of the back button, defeating the purpose of trying to keep users on your site.

Ten: Answering Questions
- ensure the information users most want is both available and easily accessible
- not including prices is a common mistake in this area
